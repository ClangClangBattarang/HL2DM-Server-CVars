// Name: Default HL2:DM Physics
// Dependencies: SourceMod
// ====================================================

// I made this to fuck with physics, as the HL2DM hides a lot of these cvars because...I don't know. Anyway, using SourceMod to execute these commands instead as I doubt Valve will fix this.
// Relevant CVARs are usually found with "cl", "sk", and "sv" at the front.

// Some of these may not be default due to a lack of documentation, but for the most part it is close to vanilla.
// Occassionally useful resoruce: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_of_HL2_Cvars

// ====================================================
// Global Stuff (i.e. players & props)
// ====================================================

sm_cvar sv_gravity 600 // Effects everything, including fall damage and height. Def. 600
sm_cvar sv_friction 4 // How sticky the player is to the floor Def. 4
sm_cvar sv_waterfriction 1 // Similar to the above, but seems to act like a multiplier against normal friction physics. I only noticed anything with high negative values. Def. 1

// ====================================================
// Player Acceleration
// ====================================================

sm_cvar sv_accelerate 10 // How long it takes to reach top speed. Values between 0 and 5 guarentee you'll never hit top speed, while negative values not only reverse the directional keys, they are effected by the reverse acceleration engine quirk (high negative values go to lightspeed). Def. 10
sm_cvar sv_airaccelerate 10 // Controls air acceleration; how easy and fast it is to turn around in midair. Increased values make it easier to turn around (i.e. circlestrafe) in midair. Def. 10
sm_cvar sv_wateraccelerate 10 // Not noticable if this does anything at all? Def. 10

// Movement thresholds
sm_cvar sv_maxspeed 320 // Caps the player's maximum ground speed. Def. 320
sm_cvar sv_maxvelocity 3500 // Maximum possible player speed. Overrides sv_maxspeed. (Possibly affects projectiles?) Def. 3500
sm_cvar sv_stopspeed 100 // Threshold for how slow the player can move before their velocity is disabled (requires friction) Def. 100

// ====================================================
// Spectator
// ====================================================

sm_cvar sv_specaccelerate 5 // Def. 5
sm_cvar sv_specnoclip 1 // Def. 1
sm_cvar sv_specspeed 3 // Def. 3

// ====================================================
// Noclip
// ====================================================

sm_cvar sv_noclipspeed 5 // Def 5
sm_cvar sv_noclipduringpause 0 // Def. 0

// ====================================================
// Steps (Possibly non-functional in HL2:DM)
// ====================================================

sm_cvar smoothstairs 1 // Bool. The game will try to "rampify" geometry so it isn't rough. Controlled by sv_stepsize. Def. 1
sm_cvar sv_stepsize 18 // How tall can a player treat a step. Negative values launch the player upwards. Def. 18

// ====================================================
// Movement acceleration
// ====================================================

// This is the speed to takes to get from a start to the player's max speed
sm_cvar cl_forwardspeed 450 // Def. 450
sm_cvar cl_backspeed 450 // Def. 450
sm_cvar cl_sidespeed 450 // Def. 450

// ====================================================
// Likely HL2 SP only - Max floor movement speed
// ====================================================

sm_cvar hl2_normspeed 190 // Run speed. Def. 190
sm_cvar hl2_sprintspeed 320 // Def. 320
sm_cvar hl2_walkspeed 150 // Def. 150

// ====================================================
// Ladders
// ====================================================

sm_cvar sv_autoladderdismount 1 // Bool. Mount or dismount ladders automatically at the top or bottom. Def. 1
sm_cvar sv_ladder_useonly 0 // Bool. Seems to respect sv_autoladderdismount. Makes ladders janky, not recommended. Def. 0
sm_cvar sv_ladderautomountdot 0.4 // When auto-mounting a ladder by looking up its axis, this is the tolerance for looking now directly along the ladder axis. Def. 0.4

// ====================================================
// Misc.
// ====================================================

// Player camera tilting
sm_cvar sv_rollangle 0 // Degrees (float). Def 0
sm_cvar sv_rollspeed 200 // How fast the view tilt is. Def. 200

sm_cvar mp_falldamage 0 // Bool. Determines how fall damage is handled. 0 sets the fall damage to 10, 1 changes fall damage to be dynamic like CS:S/HL2:SP. Def. 0
sm_cvar sv_autojump 0 // Broken; it _should_ cause the player to automatically +jump over props. Def. 0

// Sprint
sm_cvar sv_infinite_aux_power 0 // Bool. Infinite Sprint. Def. 0
sm_cvar sv_stickysprint 0 // Bool. Pressing +speed will drain all your Aux power. Def. 0
// sv_stickysprint_default 0 // Bool. CVAR likely removed in Source SDK 2013 MP. Def. 0

sm_cvar sv_bounce 0 // Multiplier for how entities (players, props etc.) bounce off each other. Def. 0
sm_cvar sv_turbophysics 0 // Bool. DoD:S prop behaviour. Makes props way more sticky and likely to damage the player when sprinted into. Def. 0
