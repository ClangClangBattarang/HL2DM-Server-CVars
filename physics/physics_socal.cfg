// These are older physics settings that were used on the SoCal #1 server, retrieved 2021-10-13. Has a variety of names; "SoCal stock", "CockMatch", and "CaliCarnage", which is likely the correct name for these settings (as that's what their new plugins call it on the server browser).

// Global Stuff (i.e. players & props)
// ====================================================

sm_cvar sv_gravity 600 // Unstated, but it's likely
sm_cvar sv_friction 4 // How sticky the player is to the floor Def. 4

// ====================================================
// Player Acceleration
// ====================================================

sm_cvar sv_accelerate 10
sm_cvar sv_airaccelerate 100 // Ten times above default; I think 150 was also experimented with, as that's a surf value

// Movement thresholds
sm_cvar sv_maxspeed 740 // Possibly 320?

// ====================================================
// Misc.
// ====================================================

// Player camera tilting
sm_cvar sv_rollangle 0 // Degrees (float). Def 0
sm_cvar sv_rollspeed 0 // How fast the view tilt is. Def. 200

// Note: I believe the current (as of Nov 10, 2021) setup uses some camera tilt.
