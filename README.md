# HL2DM Server CVars
This is a compilation of various game settings that have been recorded for both game hosting and game modding purposes.

These settings, by default, are decoupled into categories, allowing users to quickly mix and match settings.

# Requirements
* SourceMod
* MetaMod (SM dependency)

# Instructions
Copy and paste this to to hl2mp\cfg
Execute the config by typing `exec foldername/setting.cfg`
Restart the map

# Reset Values to Default
You'll need to reset a category's settings by typing `exec foldername/category_default.cfg`

# Recommended Server Stuff
* https://github.com/utharper/sourcemod-hl2dm#hl2dmfix - Part of the XMS plugin suite that not only fixes most phyiscs problems, it also allows server admins (and cheating, insecure listen servers) to change fall damage maximum by using `mp_falldamage`.
* https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=274722 - Faster Chargers plugin. Can be used to control recharge speed.
